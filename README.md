# Cutting Stock Problem

This is a 1-semester project for the course "Linear and Combinatorial Optimization".  
It includes an application written in python that can be used to enter-in a cutting-stock problem, calculate the solution using different methods, and clearly state the solution.

## Features

- A clean GUI for entering the cutting-stock problem's parameters.
- Two solving approaches:
    - Straight-forward
        - Different problem modeling options (i.e., different objective function, etc.)
    - Delayed Column Generation
- An intuitive represantation of the problem's solution.

## Try it!

### Windows 64-bit

If you are using a 64-bit Windows computer, you can download a pre-built version of the app (exe) on the releases section.

### Other

If your computer uses a different operating system (please note that this program has only been tested on 64-bit Windows) you can try running the .py file directly. You will need a python environment (at least version 3.7 is recommended) as well as the [pymprog](https://github.com/langit/pymprog) package.
